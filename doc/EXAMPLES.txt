Test runs and examples

All tests and examples are in the ./examples/ directory. The expected run times
are on a 3.6 GHz i7-3820 CPU (4 cores, 8 harware threads), using all available 
CPU cores [Not all examples benefit from parallel execution on this CPU]. 

Please keep in mind that the default configuration file (vanilla.mak) supplied
with the distribution emphasizes portability and robustness of the executable
over its performance. In particular, it enables neither the parallel (OpenMP) 
execution, nor advanced vectorization. All times shown below were obtained with
an optimized, OpenMP build (configuration file: configs/shelob-ifort_opt.mak).
An unoptimized, single-core build may result in execution wall-times longer
by a factor of 10x on the same hardware.

Sample inputs are in the the files with the *.inp extension; reference outputs 
are in matching *.out_ref files. For some of the examples, reference radial 
wavefunctions are in wfn/*.ref files.

Some of the examples involving angle-resolved photoelectron spectra require
visualization of large 3D data sets. Example visualization scripts using
OpenDX (http://www.opendx.org/) are includes in the ./dx/ subdirectory.
If OpenDX is installed, a visualization script can be started with the
command (assuming ./examples/ is the current working directory):

  dx -menubar -execute_on_change -program network-name.net

To re-run all tests, use "run-all.sh". To clean up test results, use "clean.sh".
(Both scripts are in the ./examples/ subdirectory.)

Energy-resolved photoelectron spectra are calculated in two different ways:
from the projection on stationary states within the simulation volume (main
output file) and from the projection on spherical scattering waves (output 
file specified by STS_COULOMB_WAVES). These can be visualized using 
"./examples/plot-pes.sh" and "./examples/plot-spherical-waves.sh" scripts,
respectively.

The examples are:

* [E1] Resonant 1-photon 1S->2P_0 bound transition in atomic hydrogen, using 
  linearly polarized 1.45 fs Gaussian pulse at 0.1 TW/cm^2 (peak); uniform
  300-point radial grid.

  Input:      hydrogen_1S_2P0_uniform.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   2 seconds (double); 1 second (single); 1 minute (quad)
  Reference:  hydrogen_1S_2P0_uniform.out_ref (main output)
              hydrogen_1S_2P0_uniform.out_refquad (main output, quad precision)
              wfn/H-1S-2Pz-WU-* (radial wavefunction)

  This example uses a uniform 300-point radial grid at 0.2 Bohr resolution.
  Relatively coarse uniform grid allows large time steps, so that the entire
  simulation takes 500 time steps. The accuracy is still quite good, with
  the H ground state computed at -0.500018 Hartree. 1S->2P0 excitation
  probability is 0.3098E-02. Single-precision version of the example gives
  a result accurate to 4 significant digits. Quad- and double-precision
  results agree to 12 digits.

  This example should be compared to [E2], which uses a much tighter grid.

* [E1a] Restart of [E1]

  Input:      hydrogen_1S_2P0_uniform_restart.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   2 seconds (double); 1 second (single); 1 minute (quad)
  Reference:  hydrogen_1S_2P0_uniform_restart.out_ref (main output)
              hydrogen_1S_2P0_uniform_restart.out_refquad (main output, quad precision)

  Please note that the results from the restarted run will not be bit-for-bit identical 
  to the checkpointed run, due to caching of intermediate results and differences in
  round-off errors between parallel runs.

* [E2] Resonant 1-photon 1S->2P_0 bound transition in atomic hydrogen, using 
  linearly polarized 1.45 fs Gaussian pulse at 0.1 TW/cm^2 (peak); log-uniform
  1000-point grid, grid spacing varies from 0.02 to 0.2 Bohr.

  Input:      hydrogen_1S_2P0.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   1 minute (double); 40 seconds (single); 40 minutes (quad)
  Reference:  hydrogen_1S_2P0.out_ref (main output)
              hydrogen_1S_2P0.out_refquad (main output, quad precision)
              wfn/H-1S-2Pz-WL-* (radial wavefunction)

  Log-uniform grid leads to a less well-behaved Hamiltonian, necessitating
  a larger number of time steps (20000) to maintain numerical stability.
  The numerical accuracy is also higher, with the ground state at -0.4999933.
  1S->2P0 excitation probability is 0.30988E-02. Single-precision version
  of the example is accurate to 3 significant digits. Quad- and double-precision
  results agree to 12 digits.

* [E3] 1-photon ionization of hydrogen 2P_0 state, using Z-polarized 1.45 fs 
  pulse at 1TW/cm^2 (peak) and 13.6 eV central energy; log-uniform 1000-point 
  grid, spacing varies from 0.02 to 0.2 Bohr.

  Input:      hydrogen_2P0_ion.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   1 minute (double); 50 seconds (single); 1 hour (quad)
  Reference:  hydrogen_2P0_ion.out_ref (main output)
              hydrogen_2P0_ion.out_refquad (main output, quad precision)
              hydrogen_2P0_ion_waves.table_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, Coulomb spherical waves)
              hydrogen_2P0_ion_pes_volkov.dx_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, plane waves)
              hydrogen_2P0_ion_pes_coulomb.dx_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, Coulomb plane waves)
              hydrogen_2P0_ion.net (OpenDX visualization network)
              wfn/H-2Pz-WL-* (radial wavefunction)

  Total ionization probability in the S channel is 0.2023E-04; in the D channel
  0.1139E-03. Single-precision version of the example gives 3 significant digits
  in ionization probability. A weak 2-photon peak is also seen in P channel 
  (0.2657E-08 probability) and F channel (0.1318E-08 probability). Single-
  precision run reproduces these peaks, but also produces spurious peaks at the
  same probability level at higher energies. Quad- and double-precision
  results agree to 12 digits.

  This example also calculates photoelectron spectra (both angle- and energy-resolved). 
  Note how the (approximate) energy-resolved PES calculated from box states misses
  some of the interference structures and exaggerates the zero-energy structure. Also
  note how projection on the asymptotic planewaves introduces spurious inerferences
  and distorts the low-energy structure, compared to the scattering-state projection.
  In single precision, the angle-resolved PES shows noise floor at 1e-4 amplitude
  level, but is otherwise OK.

* [E3a] Restart of [E3]

  Input:      hydrogen_2P0_ion_restart.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   1 minute (double); 50 seconds (single); 1 hour (quad)
  Reference:  hydrogen_2P0_ion_restart.out_ref (main output)

              hydrogen_2P0_ion.net (OpenDX visualization network)

  Please note that the results from the restarted run will not be bit-for-bit identical 
  to the checkpointed run, due to caching of intermediate results and differences in
  round-off errors between parallel runs.

* [E4] 1-photon ionization of 3P_1 state of model Ar potential in the vicinity of
  Cooper minimum, using Z-polarized 1.45 fs pulse at 1TW/cm^2 (peak) and 46.3 eV;
  log-uniform 2000-point grid, spacing varies from 0.005 to 0.15 Bohr.

  Input:      argon_3P1_cooper.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   4 minutes (double); 3.5 minutes (single); 6 hours (quad)
  Reference:  argon_3P1_cooper.out_ref (main output)
              argon_3P1_cooper.out_refquad (main output, quad precision)
              argon_3P1_cooper_waves.table_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, Coulomb spherical waves)
              argon_3P1_cooper_pes_volkov.dx_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, plane waves)
              argon_3P1_cooper_pes_coulomb.dx_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, Coulomb plane waves)
              argon_3P1_cooper.net (OpenDX visualization network)
              wfn/Ar-2P1-Cooper-* (radial wavefunction)

  This example uses an effective potential designed to reproduce experimental
  one-electron removal energies in Argon atom. The 3P state of this potential
  is at -0.581373 Hartree; current grid gives -0.581416 Hartree. The photon
  energy is chosen near the Cooper minimum of this potential. The total ionization
  probability is 0.2875E-06 (all in the D channel). Note the characteristic 
  twinned profile of the 1-photon peak in the photoelectron spectrum.
  Single-precision version gives about 2 significant digits for the ionization 
  probability. Quad- and double-precision results agree to 12 digits.

  We also calculate energy- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectra for this
  example. Note how the twinned main ionization peak is fully resolved in the
  spherical-wave expansion, but is smeared-out in the box-decomposition spectrum
  (which neglectes interference effects). Note also that a fraction of the wavefunction
  has escaped the simulation box by the time simulation ends (final norm 0.999999999739).
  This causes artifacts in the spectrum at the 1e-10 level in amplitude, clearly 
  visible for photoelectron energies above 2 Hartree. These artifacts can be eliminated 
  by either increasing the size of the simulation both (both for STS_COULOMB_ATEND
  and STS_VOLKOV_ATEND), or by activating in-TDSE projection on Volkov states
  (STS_VOLKOV=.TRUE.; affects only the spectrum calculated by STS_VOLKOV_ATEND;
  see example [E5] below). 

  The single-precision PES looks superficially very similar, but contains a spurious 
  peak at 1.7 Hartree (the photon energy). Switching to a more accurate linear solver 
  (M3D_SOLVER='refined'/M3D_ITERATIONS=2) eliminates the spurious peak, and brings
  out the noise floor at the expected 1e-4 amplitude level.

  This example should be compared to [E5] below.

* [E5] 1-photon ionization of 3P_1 state of model Ar potential away from the Cooper
  minimum, using Z-polarized 1.45 fs pulse at 1TW/cm^2 (peak) and 55.0 eV

  Input:      argon_3P1_offcooper.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   4 minutes (double); 4 minutes (single); 6 hours (quad)
  Reference:  argon_3P1_offcooper.out_ref (main output)
              argon_3P1_offcooper.out_refquad (quadruple precision)
              argon_3P1_offcooper_waves.table_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, Coulomb spherical waves)
              argon_3P1_offcooper_waves.table_refquad (Ditto, quad precision)
              argon_3P1_offcooper_pes_volkov.dx_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, plane waves)
              argon_3P1_offcooper_pes_coulomb.dx_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, Coulomb plane waves)
              argon_3P1_offcooper.net (OpenDX visualization network)
              wfn/Ar-2P1-Off-Cooper-* (radial wavefunction)

  This example is the same as [E4], except for the photon energy chosen about
  9 eV above the Cooper minimum. The total ionization probability is now
  3.3060E-06 (D channel). Single-precision version gives 3 significant digits
  in ionization probability. Double- and quad-precision results agree to 12 digits.

  In the energy-resolved photoelectron spectrum calculated from the Coulomb 
  spherical-wave expansion (argon_3P1_offcooper_waves.table), the two-photon
  peak at 3.4H is nearly obscured by the leakage noise from the population
  leaving the box (final norm 0.999999981976). This peak is clearly visible 
  in the approximate spectrum calculated from the energy decomposition.
  The leakage artifacts are absent in the Volkov-state projection, which 
  used a combination of STS_VOLKOV=.T. and STS_VOLKOV_ATEND=.T. to capture
  the entire population. The single-precision PES is essentially identical to
  the double-precision result, with a slightly higher noise floor.

  This example should be compared to [E4] above.

* [E6] 1-photon ionization of 3P_{-1} state of model Ar potential by left circularly
  polarized (XY polarization plane) 1.45 fs pulse at 30 eV and 2TW/cm^2;
  log-uniform 1400-point grid, spacing varies from 0.005 to 0.15 Bohr.

  Input:      argon_3P1m_circ_l.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   5 minutes (double); 4 minutes (single); 6 hours (quad)
  Reference:  argon_3P1m_circ_l.out_ref (main output)
              argon_3P1m_circ_l.out_refquad (quadruple precision)
              argon_3P1m_circ_l_waves.table_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, Coulomb spherical waves)
              argon_3P1m_circ_l_pes_volkov.dx_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, plane waves)
              argon_3P1m_circ_l_pes_coulomb.dx_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, Coulomb plane waves)
              argon_3P1m_circ_l.net (OpenDX visualization network)
              wfn/Ar-2P1m-circ_l-* (radial wavefunction, partial)

  This is a non-axially-symmetric weak-field example. The only open ionization
  channel is to L=2/M=-2 continuum. Calculated 1-photon ionization probability is 
  7.3674E-04. The 2-photon peak (in L=3/M=-3 continuum) is barely visible, with 
  ionization probability 3.460E-8.

  Single precision version is accurate to 2 significant digits for the 1-photon
  probability. The double and quad-precision values agree to 10 significant digits.

  Note that angle-resolved scattering-wave photoelectron spectra (argon_3P1m_circ_l_waves.table
  and argon_3P1m_circ_l_pes_coulomb.dx) show a noise floor at approximately 1e-7 amplitude,
  arising due to the wavefunction leackage from the simulation volume (final norm 0.999999574668). 
  This problem is not present for the Volkov-state projection, where both STS_VOLKOV and 
  STS_VOLKOV_ATEND are activated. However, the maximum of the main ionization peak is shifted
  to approximately 88-degree azimuphal angle, compared to approximately 85 degrees for the
  Coulomb-wave spectrum. The single-precision PES is essentially identical, except for a
  slightly higher noise floor. 

  The scattering-state projections agree to 1e-10 amplitude for the double- and quad-precision 
  runs. The Volkov state projections aftree to 1e-3 for low final momenta (<0.05 Bohr/jiffy
  aka 30meV energy), to 1e-5 for final momenta above 0.5 Bohr/jiffy (3.5 eV).

  This example should be compared to [E7] below.

* [E7] 1-photon ionization of 3P_{-1} state of model Ar potential by right circularly
  polarized (XY polarization plane) 1.45 fs pulse at 30 eV and 2TW/cm^2;
  log-uniform 1400-point grid, spacing varies from 0.005 to 0.15 Bohr.

  Input:      argon_3P1m_circ_r.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   5 minutes (double); 3 minutes (single); 6 hours (quad)
  Reference:  argon_3P1m_circ_r.out_ref (main output)
              argon_3P1m_circ_r.out_refquad (quadruple precision)
              argon_3P1m_circ_r_waves.table_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, Coulomb spherical waves)
              argon_3P1m_circ_r_pes_volkov.dx_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, plane waves)
              argon_3P1m_circ_r_pes_coulomb.dx_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, Coulomb plane waves)
              argon_3P1m_circ_r.net (OpenDX visualization network)
              wfn/Ar-2P1m-circ_r-* (radial wavefunction, partial)

  This example is nearly identical to [E6], except the laser pulse is now right
  circular-polarized. Now, the L=0/M=0 (3.4722E-4 probability) and L=2/M=0 
  (1.2282E-4 probability) channels are open for 1-photon ionization. 2-photon
  channels to L=1/M=1 (1.5152E-9 probability) and L=3/M=1 (2.3072E-9) are
  also visible. 

  Single-precision version gives 1-photon channels to 2-3 significant digits. 
  The 2-photon channel probability is not well reproduced. Double and quad-precision
  results agree to 9 significant digits

  The scattering-wave spectra (argon_3P1m_circ_r_waves.table and argon_3P1m_circ_r_pes_coulomb.dx)
  have a noise pedestal at the 1e-7 amplitude level, due to the wavefunction leakage from
  the simulation volume (final norm 0.999999636965). Single-precision PES are essentially
  identical, except for the slightly higher noise floor. Quad- and double-precision PES
  agree to 9 significant digits (Coulomb-wave spectra) or 5 (for p<0.05) to 7 (for p>0.5)
  digits (Volkov-state spectra).

* [E8] High-harmonics generation from 1S state of hydrogen atom by linearly-polarized
  4.84 fs 100 TW 800 nm pulse. Log-uniform 300-point grid, grid spacing varies from 
  0.04 to 0.4 Bohr. The simulation continues to 24.2 fs to let residual dipole ring 
  down.

  Input:      hydrogen_1S_hhg_linear.inp
              hydrogen_1S_hhg_linear.dhr (requires dyson_harmonics.x, not part of this package)
  Cores used: 8 (logical) / 4 (physical)
  Run time:   4 minutes (double); 4 hours (quad)
  Reference:  hydrogen_1S_hhg_linear.out_ref (main output)
              hydrogen_1S_hhg_linear.out_refquad (quadruple precision)
              hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical_spec.pdf (HHG power spectrum)

  This example illustrates simulation of a high-harmonics spectrum for a hydrogen
  atom subject to an linearly polarized field. The free-oscillation radius in this 
  field is about 17 Bohr. Because the absorbing boundary starts at 78 Bohr, 
  contributions from both short and long trajectories are included.
  The expected harmonic cut-off is at 1.20 Hartree (32.7 eV; H21). 
  The final population within the box is 0.99166. Remaining population 
  of the 1S ground state is 0.98923. The HHG power spectrum can be derived by 
  Fourier-transforming the real part of the time-dependent dipole 
  [in hydrogen_1S_hhg_linear.detail]. The reference spectrum, showing 
  \omega^4 |d_\omega|^2, is in hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical_spec.pdf.

  This example experiences a nearly complete loss of significance in single precision.
  The double- and quad-precion results agree to 10 significant digits.

  This example should be compared to [E11]

* [E9] Strong-field ionization of hydrogen 2P_0 state by 4.84 fs pulse at 800 nm and
  100 TW/cm^2 (peak); log-uniform 2200-point grid, spacing varies from 0.04 to 0.4 Bohr.

  Input:      hydrogen_2P0_sfi.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   2 hours (double); 1.5 hours (single); 4 days (quad)

              hydrogen_2P0_sfi.net (DX visualisation script)

  This example calculates an ATI spectrum due to strong-field ionization by a short
  near-IR pulse. Due to the high field intensity, an extended angular grid is
  necessary to reach convergence (Lmax = 30 in this example). Because an extended
  radial grid is needed to prevent electron density reaching the boundary, the 
  radial grid is relatively coarse, and the initial 2P state has energy of
  -0.1250013. The 1S ground state is at -0.4999884H on this grid. The simulation 
  is still axially symmetric. 

  The pulse is sufficiently intense to nearly fully ionize the atom; the final 
  energy is 0.70073E-01 Hartree. Only 2.69% of the initial population is left
  in L=1 bound states; the most populated bound channel is L=3 (10.55%). The
  maximum of the continuum population is in L=4 channel (21.05%), with significant
  population (3.02E-04 probability) still present in L=15 continuum. The Up in
  this system is about 6 eV; the ATI peaks are seen up to 55 eV, consistent
  with the 10Up recollision plateau cut-off. The electron free-oscillation radius 
  in this example is 16.5 Bohr. To reduce boundary artifacts in the PES, we place
  the t-SURF boundary 33 Bohr away from the absorber (this only affects the
  in-TDSE term in STS_VOLKOV=.T.). The total wavefunction is nearly completely 
  contained within the simulation volume (final population 0.999999999996), so
  that the scattering-state projected spectrum is essentially artifact-free
  (hydrogen_2P0_sfi_waves.table, hydrogen_2P0_sfi_pes_coulomb.dx). The leakage
  noise floor is at 1e-13 amplitude. Large differences between the Coulomb and
  Volkov-state spectra are seen for the low-energy structure.

  In single precision, the results agree to 2 significant digits for ionization
  probabilities and energies. The noise floor is the PES is at 1e-2 amplitude
  - still sufficiently low to resolve the entire ATI progression. The double-
  and quadruple-precision results agree to 12 digits.

  We use a pivoted linear solver with iterative refinement of the solutions.
  With the default unpivoted solver, this example experiences a nearly complete 
  loss of significance in single precision.

* [E10] Strong-field ionization of hydrogen 2P_0 state by 4.84 fs pulse at 800 nm and
  100 TW/cm^2 (peak); log-uniform 400-point grid, spacing varies from 0.04 to 0.4 Bohr.

  Input:      hydrogen_2P0_sfi_tsurf.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   18 minutes (double); 13 minutes (single); 24 hours (quad)
  Reference:  hydrogen_2P0_sfi_tsurf.out_ref (main output)

              hydrogen_2P0_sfi.net (DX visualisation script)


  This example calculates an ATI spectrum due to strong-field ionization by a short
  near-IR pulse, using projection on Volkov states (the "t-SURF" method). We use
  the same radial grid as in the example [E9], but terminate the grid at 150 Bohr.
  As before, we place the t-SURF boundary 33 Bohr (twice the free-oscillation radius)
  away from the absorber. 

  Because the matching sphere is quite close to the origin (85 Bohr away), Volkov states
  are no longer a good approximation to the asymptotic wavefunction. For an undamped
  Coulomb potential, this leads to artifactual floor in amplitudes, at about 1e-3 level.
  Instead, we choose to force the potential to zero at a finite range (POT_MASK). This
  modification reduces the level of artifacts to about 1e-5. However, the change in the
  potential cause considerable changes in the dynamics. For example, the survival
  probability for the initial state is now 2.606e-4, compared to 2.855e-3 for the original
  potential; the total ionization probability is 74.5%, compared to 76.5% for the unmodified
  potential. There is still a fair agreement between the two angle-resolved photoelectron
  spectra, except at the near-zero photoelectron momenta.

  Single-precision calculation agrees to 2-3 digits in energies and ionization probabilities.
  The single-precision angle-resolved PES is essentially identical to the double-precision
  result, with the noise floor at 1e-3 amplitude. Larger deviations are seen for momenta
  below 0.5 Bohr/jiffy. Double- and quadruple-precision results agree to 11 significant digits

* [E11] High-harmonics generation from 1S state of hydrogen atom by elliptically-polarized
  (Ey/Ez = 0.1) 4.84 fs 100 TW 800 nm pulse. Log-uniform 300-point grid, grid spacing
  varies from 0.04 to 0.4 Bohr. The simulation continues to 24.2 fs to let residual
  dipole ring down.

  Input:      hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical.inp
              hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical.dhr (requires dyson_harmonics.x, not part of the package)

              hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical_spec.pdf (HHG power spectrum)

  This example illustrates simulation of a high-harmonics spectrum for a hydrogen
  atom subject to an elliptically polarized field (ellipticity 0.1). The free-oscillation
  radius in this field is about 17 Bohr. Because the absorbing boundary starts at
  78 Bohr, contributions from both short and long trajectories are included.
  The expected harmonic cut-off is at 1.20 Hartree (32.7 eV; H21). 
  The final population within the box is 0.99177. Remaining population 
  of the 1S ground state is 0.98964. The HHG power spectrum can be derived by 
  Fourier-transforming the real part of the time-dependent dipole [in H-1S-hhg-ell.detail].
  The reference spectrum, showing \omega^4 |d_\omega|^2, is in hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical.pdf.

  This example experiences a nearly complete loss of significance in single precision.
  Double and quadruple-precision results agree to 10 significant digits.

  This example should be compared to [E8]

* [E12] High-harmonics generation from 1S state of hydrogen atom by elliptically-polarized
  (Ey/Ez = 0.1) 4.84 fs 100 TW 800 nm pulse. Log-uniform 300-point grid, grid spacing
  varies from 0.04 to 0.4 Bohr. The simulation continues to 24.2 fs to let residual
  dipole ring down.

  Input:      hydrogen_1S_hhg_ell_refsol.inp
              hydrogen_1S_hhg_ell_refsol.dhr (requires dyson_harmonics.x, not part of the package)
  Cores used: 8 (logical) / 4 (physical)
  Run time:   3 hours (double); 2.5 hours (single)
  Reference:  hydrogen_1S_hhg_ell_refsol.out_ref (main output)
              hydrogen_1S_hhg_ell_refsol_pes_volkov.dx_ref (Photoelectron spectrum, plane waves)
              hydrogen_1S_hhg_ell_refsol.net (OpenDX visualization network)

  This example illustrates simulation of a high-harmonics spectrum for a hydrogen
  atom subject to an elliptically polarized field (ellipticity 0.1), together with
  the photoelectron spectrum using projection on Volkov states (the "t-SURF" method).
  The pulse and grid are identical to the [E11] example. We use pivoted linear solver 
  with iterative refinement to improve numerical stability of the simulation. In
  double precision, the more accurate solver produces results essentially identical
  to the unpivoted solver in [E11]. The final total norm is 0.9917738744*73* (vs.
  0.991773874*41* for unpivoted). The final total energy is -0.4948682573*87*H (vs.
  -0.4948682573*71* for unpivoted). There are similar differences for the 
  individual state populations, eg. 1S is 0.9896392146*892* vs. 0.9896392146*568*.

  In single precision, the energies and populations agree to 2-3 significant digits.
  The dipole power spectrum is visually indictinguishable from the double-precision
  result.

  The photoelectron spectrum is of very low quality due to the close proximity of the 
  matching sphere to the origin (R=45.1 Bohr). The artifacts can be somewhat reduced
  by forcing the long-range potential to zero before it reaches the matching sphere
  (POT_MASK), at the cost of introducing other artifacts in the PES and the HHG spectrum.

  The single-precision angle-resolved PES agrees to the double-precision result to
  1e-2 in amplitudes.

  This example should be compared to [E11]
